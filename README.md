**Hartree–Fock Roothaan implementation for arbitrary N-basis sets**  
A computational chemistry tool that solves Hartree–Fock equations using the Roothaan–Hall formalism.  
Written in **Python** with **C** extensions for Gaussian integrals and a **PyQt** GUI.

## Features
- Supports arbitrary basis set size
- Gaussian integral evaluation in C for performance
- Interactive GUI to load molecules and visualize orbitals

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sasha.git
